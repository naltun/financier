All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]
# Further features to be added accordingly
-Updated README
-Add ncurses function
-Add a script argument that allows a user to *only* view a certain coin's statistics, eg:
	$ financier [-o/--only-display=] reddcoin

Doing so will _also_ display global statistics
-Add 'comparison' feature, which will use a local data store of all the values returned from
	a web request, and will make a comparison to the previous call's values. It will display
	positive/negative changes to each value. This feature will be callable from a command line
	argument, eg:
	$ financier [-c/--compare]
